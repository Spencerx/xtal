Miniaiture Crystal Radio, this is project doument and create the smallest crystal radio.

Radio is more than a century old in any way we are still just getting to know it better because of that time domain restraints, so what would have a radio inventor done differently more than a century ago with some of the tools we have today? 
 Spark gap transimtters are not active like crystal radio, a good reason for it's persistsnce is the simplicity of ther radio circuit and building parts which arte not common in most electronic stockists but you can make do with the current suppliers online. 
A drawback is the requirement of a large antenna(this is a current research topic at the IOP among many others), ofcourse there are a number of ways a electronics designer can approach this including making a integrated ciruit design on for a System on Chips for complex maybe novel or trivial pursposes because we also have software radio to consider, as long as there's the right design it possible to mix analogue computing and digital computing with dedicated devices for specific results in mixed signal environments.
