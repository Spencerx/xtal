                                                E&OE, WikiPaper

        This text is based on pure motivation to focus on were the current possibilities on minimal and maximal design at scale to read the stops
        and see the traffic for what it it in current computer, electronics and optoelectronic architecture or design lie to see more out of less.
        "Keeping it simple stupid" is difficult when you probably need a e/GPU for start menu resolution and
        'Windows Icons Menus & Pointers or Pull Downs', Human Computer Interaction is searching for productivity.
        Most gadgets suffer from a limit of usability when users are expected to keep up with cry baby or town crier notifications when you drop
        a packet or two in transit when devices are really mobile devices expected to keep sync with a 4G/5G when users are moving or travelling!
        Certain number of devices after a few key presses do not require constant attention, some have simply added a touchscreen for convenience
        and it would be worth noting such good design examples as reference designs.
        Devices ideally don't need constant attention a if in intensive care they need to be durable, minimising the number of devices you carry
        in a single trip to one or two rather a multitude of power hungry devices for a journey going 'road warriors',
        power is always intermittent and setting up a mobile workstation is not the most practical thing to do when you have to charge unless
        full on on mobile camping or 'glamping'.
        Facing the limits of the most basic devices on the merit of core bandwidth, memory and processing power with metal semiconductors working
        on pure electrical signals rather than a mixture of optotelectronics across analog or digital domains.
        Mind the gap, we have bugs carried over from the millennia before us and it is wise to understand these solutions need to be rolled out in
        humanely possible constraints but understanding resources in the context of the past, present future thinking content that looking to be
        innovated into existence as a service to humanity - that's the basic tenet of engineering like architecture and everything it houses it
        starts as a simple idea, I emphasise Lego blocks and we can too point at things such as search spiders - Google and so on as the bits that
        articulate your quest into understand more from less resources in your hands at your fingertips including devices. So up to a point, you
        will be satisfied that along with any modifications you make you will have to refer to current software defined tooling along with capable
        hardware which can be sophisticated or very simple, maybe too simple when you have ideas everywhere not necessarily meant for the task at
        hand, allowing for different methods of thinking as in artistic, computational, design, materials, metrology, scientific, systems thinking
        at different scales to settle for simple problems in a complex subject that can harness both analogue and digital computing. It is useful
        to think about viral thinking(anti social media and repetitive disease cycles) and see how structured or any form of thinking
        is not exactly like formatting a drive, it should help put in to context how visual and large chunks of information float in and out
        of a human minds with ease but we easily take for granted how this information is processed naturally from data and see what overthink
        is to keep the mind cool, you don't need a pandemic two decades after a fresh one to create a antidotes but from the first occurrence,
        it also means we have not gotten smarter ever since the first strain of the virus until several mutations, if this was a desk
        with a large monitor would that help because we assume all this is not new information,
        with the right tools a new way of working can help solve hard or soft problems.
        It takes some thought and improved ways of operation of existing systems without burning both ends of the candle, expecting optical quantum
        computers when you can optical computers with existing semiconductors systems to solve
        rigorous problems with faster throughput and purpose made language, vocabulary for higher memory footprints with lower energy or thermal
        problem statements, quantum entanglement and tunnelling is CE electronics shop material just yet but you can enjoy some level
        of robust communications between you and a service via fiber because of quantum technology as it is.
        Fiber systems across the globe can transmit more data than people can stomach to begin with, in a closed loop,
        here we talk about knowledge as the medium of exchange but don't present it as the be all in a abstract expression of value in the
        face of a zero waste counters which is vague until picked up by 'consumer chains' beyond the scope of this except for how semiconductors
        are not recycled in various places around the world, this goes for throw away consumer electronics such as computers or mobiles that
        have limited RAM and no expandable memory, many laptops look like low grade smartphones in that dim light ready to go to the
        landfill when they drop and become to frustrating for their users in the dark about the limits of information and specifications of
        their chosen devices.
        It also necessary to note that opportunities can not be limited to the vocabulary of problem spaces, seeing opportunities as problems,
        there is the need to see them through the eyes of mechanics not the grease monkey type but the geophysics and physics type as in the 19th
        century without reference to then or undocumented limits of  "mechanism" however to large scale mega machines and small scale nano machines
        at the limit of current design, engineering science that should aid the actor/viewer inside or outside systems
        to see possibility of solving problems such as micro plastics with visible solutions online leaving something for imagination to solve
        apart from red tape which is another animal altogether in a different maybe backward setting were there is no progress, that's a
        a blank sheet or a dark sky canvas, lets just say a blanks screen to see how people can interact with content
        as a creative opportunity.
        So systems architect, developer or system integrator can speak of objects in a practical sense but for a everyday super user who has to
        interact with many other users, object orientation and design there of is just the beginning, the same way a engineer does things,
        for the incoming generations this is no mean feat with the level developments that newer developers of systems are expected to stay ahead off.

        In this brief I simply point at how a object that still is a part of many homes or places still has aeons to go in space and time it's not
        faster than light yet but this will have to be possible just in case humanity finally decides to explore the stars,
        so artistically thinking this can be expressed as anything that will follow a pattern of surviving the changes a home might go through in
        the coming millennia because in look at the short term change from the last century in to the current one we simply carried on with a
        certain direction apart from the obvious near term we need more than just artistic rendition even if it follows the best mathematical models
        which after all some people always think mathematicians are unemployed and too theoretical to be part of their daily work even if they
        themselves have to do specific calculations, yes it has its limits just like a world with a economic gain first at undefined costs but always
        at the beck and call of resources available, after all it's very easy to ignore where all resources come from when we already have them.
        New manufacturing or prototyping methods should help alleviate when we scale down and up the components needed in different scenarios,
        so this the case for desktop engineering facing its new direction and this can be sanity check projection of what a project can be when
        engineers can afford to scale down components and look forward to the future without having to throw away anything they develop in the
        first place, that is a challenge some have already accepted.~

Miniature Crystal Radio, this is project document and create the smallest crystal radio with common tools or or lab alternatives. And illustrate less from more. This is not exactly the crystal method, because real crystal take ages to grow but we can deal with the lab grown variety in additive and printing in three dimensions. After all it needs are a few components less than a dozen and it is good to go, so it is a minimalist's ideal and offers minimalist design
that can build around the user with any principal along with orthogonal, responsive, user discovery and focused features that even a circuit designer does not have
to be Deiter Rams or Philippe Starck to figure out how much components are heading for landfill, plain (EU)USB-C included but especially semiconductors because there's no way to guarantee recapture of lost materials once they are sold as hard won as they are, this is ironic not exactly a rusty issue because the so called circular economy is going to be very important in having a working office on mars on the moon especially before anyone gets there, the same methods and thinking of the last millennia are the habits defaulting to a race of geological resources at any cost without a global effort on reclaiming finished products at their end of life. The same way you need a catalogue of fuels to have sustainable output on a ship, lets say a research ship for the sake imagination when you have Hydrogen, Diesel-Gas, Solar or Wind except for nuclear fusion which is not here yet and fission is not practical you can have ammonia as your first renewable element in that equation were your machines can make useful byproducts in the process the two scenarios are not similar in the same way the rising tides and accessibility to energy and water go hand in hand, like the waste catch twenty two depending on who you talk to, it's a chicken and egg picture were you buy your gadget you really don't return it you expect to get more of the same with no upstream just downstream, the pipes are not the only medium for both water and the matter that carries data, optical fiber, so it's also interesting to talk about water scarcity in land geo locked in ocean, just to make fun of grammar and locked in water value scenario it's not exactly geofenced but it is necessary to see it that way, when people talk about nature being some kind of trust(afarian). USB^ is like Lego so we can build around its versatility with 3D prints because in the age of additive prototyping and manufacturing, fiber and anything near semiconducting graphene are the catalysts for objective standards using the best materials at hand in continuous testing phases. By using this crystal radio we can encode the method with routines in test phase to define the simplest circuit with compute abilities along with signal processing ability with currently available ICs and optoelectronics across the digital domain, at interesting side note is how quantum entanglement, super position and tunnelling have radio applications at all.
By adding each advance incrementally as by judging radio's general timeline, discovery of new features will be natural process exploring the possibilities of the physical layer at any level right down to microns and up to millimetres across as long as imagination is the key input when facing the possibilities presented by expert circuit and application level interface models. So analogue controls are still very practical and adding software controls, the question is how hardware you usually associate with desktop or laptop format connect via USB is something you integrate with portable, well USB for now but on a board level or simply inline like a analogue or digital remote control usually associated with portable audio devices. From a design perspective having both a hardware and software interface can make discovery a mere at a glance routine with the addition of further features a user defined drag and drop experience, in hardware this simple enough to add the desired control switch, rocker, knob or light for function or any other type of electrical or optical control input without giving the wrong idea about the features that can be added on demand by adding custom components and controls.
So it is possible to keep it simple, add a block or another to extend the circuitry because you already have all these in mobile devices depending on how they can be accessed in regard to soft controls, the processing needs to be resource efficient to make them realtime.

Home Made ICs are nothing new to those who have seen them before, it is possible to fabricate monolithic circuits of but the applications
are a has been in their focus, so it's time to think of getting rid of the shortages then focus on making nanotechnology chips
that look beyond the pale of pure electrical circuits in a domain of analogue and digital optics in addition to semiconductor
electronics as revamped optotelectronics with 3D printed circuits. With chips, meta materials and new semiconductor materials that allow the integration of the simplest circuits or even simpler bread boarding prototypes for novel applications or trivialisation, it all depends on the user.
With mundane questions such as fixed, ganged, parallel, series variable capacitors, inductors, resistors, the question of miniature transformers
which can be used in numbers to achieve a specific value as defined by device specifications.
Using fiber optics in addition to pure metal wires which in turn means MEMS, meta materials among a few other replicable
research materials of the last decade with the question of exact science at that scale to current levels of existing chip fabs.


Radio is more than a century old in any way we are still just getting to know it better because of that time domain restraints, so what would have a radio inventor done differently more than a century ago with some of the tools we have today?
Rewiring and re-configuring a circuit using any processing power or ability should be as easy as making a new drawing, it's also necessary to have all this at the first page or top of the page of any design tool.
Spark gap transmitters are not active like crystal radio, a good reason for it's persistence is the simplicity of the radio circuit and building parts which are not common in most electronic stockists but you can make do with the current suppliers online. It is also interesting to see some analog receivers are no longer
in production and spares are missing maybe materials as such that don't have any supply chains, it is possible to synthesise newer materials especially at
a nano technology scale that has to be exploited to the fullest.
So we have all manner and type of design opportunities, like any opportunity it has to be missed to be seen in order to be made into a design brief. It is possible to see people dumping electronic gear and radio stats can be deceiving because of that little wasteful fact alone, there's more trash in orbit than service recycling included - all this trash should be included on NASA's Planetary Data System under near earth space weather, the circular economy is yet to reach orbit so expect more trash on the moon and mars soon. The common thought is that there is not enough power to deal with real world problems(it is said(don't forget to) laugh), even though some smartphones are more powerful than some super computers from a very few decades ago. Just because people are looking at their phones doesn't mean they are changing the way they are looking at things because devices have to fit into a set of daily habits, routines or what you want to do in your time(calendar checkbox, check) there has to be the physical content were people usually allow all types of weather or other mass event natural phenomena to take over in advance, it is possible to "mitigate" most known events because we are so keen to prove that we are smarter than dinosaurs. So feel free to think clearly and freely.

Radio really needs to be as simple as a small Lego kit for anyone to relate to what's going on inside and around them, radio is that simple.
Some reference text at the end of the file for the sake of reading. This is by no means a rundown on a bare bones radio that already works as long as you have a signal to tune into, it's as bare bones as the circuits, diagrams you will run into. Also it's not a shakedown of all the unpublished innovations derived from this passive self powered device.

Because as a basic circuit, it can prove very basic processing of electrical and optical signal components, the optical component can forgo all the known bottlenecks in both analogue and digital domains at speed with a question of materials that can allow tuning of bandwidth or simply allow for broadband or narrow band dependent on test conditions. Design complexity is another thing to consider well afterwards, it is necessary to have devices that allow for smarter energy footprints without worrying about restricting device capabilities to create more service choices including design as a service on demand with rapid prototyping
for electronics which seems to have not enjoyed as much advances as other finished products may posses in their simplicity.
A drawback is the requirement of a large antenna(this is a current research topic at the IOP among many others), of course there are a number of ways a electronics designer can approach this including making a integrated circuit design on for a System on Chips for complex maybe novel or trivial purposes because we also have software radio to consider, as long as there's the right design it possible to mix analogue computing and digital computing with dedicated devices for specific results in mixed signal environments. The circuit is a trivial design except for the case of a IC or VLSI chip design which can help existing refine additive or three dimensional printing of chips as proof of conceptual devices for early adopters of said printers or fabrication plans with that ability in house or lab. A question is how you can integrate carbon nano tubes, because we mention ink, immediately we picture some kind of ink jet or laser 3D print layered process and it is still wise to stick to surfaces that support semiconductors and optical signals - today you already have RF over fiber and power over fiber which is enough for this simple proof of concept.


Basically there have been various examples of tiny radio circuits the most recent that still holds the smallest example of a radio receiver is the Harvard "atomic radio" example demonstrated here from December 2016 if you are still in the in a mistletoe mode in January 2024, it's not strictly speaking a crystal variant but more of a laser powered device exciting two atoms with a spin in a certain direction that can be manipulated to demodulate radio waves magnetically with a single photon(this implies modulation is possible using a phot or photon/s), for selective excitation of electronic spins in a diamond" of a certain kind, remember how CDs/DVDs spin but lasers today have complimentary materials spin that corresponds to the pattern of light from the laser or vice versa(we haven't made optical memory chips yet).
Of course you need less distortion that demonstrated in the Harvard device and should expect improvements that you can pay for by way of knowledge for a specific purposes not just the active wording of applications or use cases such as a scaled up version using nano particles also possibly nano tubes(rods), scaling at a macro level.

Scale through chips is noticeable for memory but you don't have a everyday application that you do some math except for the number of bits or bytes you have to accommodate because you have to wait online or otherwise for bandwidth on any channel type, of device, you are rarely thinking about CPU frequencies and resonance with other devices in a one way hardware dialogue that still needs breaking of basic fundamental limits in every aspect to achieve something new in design briefs especially for chips(there's a lot of one way traffic online). Optical memory for RAM or ROM application is still a holy grail yet to be achieved for everyday semiconductor electronics, to process all the bandwidth, content, data or information around anyone now especially at the speed of a keyboard, 3D touchscreen or voice gestures there's a need to absorb and move data, but see how a simple device can do all that at a glance but you can only tune into a single thing at a time.
Modern devices are made to multitask and the more sources they have the smoother the better the experience they offer especially when a device does not have to perform a CPU operation to achieve anything, such as a button press or less, background listening which is usually delegated to a dedicated chip for a file or a radio stream analogue or digital for user controls. So the analogue computing's cue for repetitive or sustainably scaling operations that can be done on a analogue computer just as math processors did until they became a mainstream feature along with GPUs which were solely for architects, designers, gamers and modellers but are now the main driving force for AI models, natural language processing and stream computing. It's really hybrid computing but the only thing missing is the components for optical components. just operating at different wavelengths in the light spectrum and you can consider meta-materials already in use for structural purposes in devices. It's important to see how this can work out in a computing cluster small scale boxes, grid scale compute blocks to shipping containers.

Other small radio examples include ICs(SoC hint) but none of them like block diagrams are ever complete, neither are they every day objects, so it is only natural to ask yourself why crystal radios ever look complete, because, that's academic. A unnatural reaction to a mind that has many firing synapses with it's dedicated neurons we have answers we have not consciously explored. Until you look at other circuits from different time periods and locations on the earth's grid you will gather that certain circuits are constructed and wired differently in different scenarios even if they come with a circuit diagram following different paths because they are period pieces from different age, but still a radio age with laser in the spectrum following up the spectrum chase. We use light emitting diodes everyday now for even for recreation of daylight or filament(incandescent bulbs are like thermionic valves) colour lighting with LEDs also for moving data with LiFi apart from closed loop fiber maybe free space optics(point to point optical links without the cable) for people who were early adopters(IrDA still in some working hardware)especially nineties computers which had magneto optical disc drives such as Mini disc transport, modern discs are a main application for laser light in the spectrum remember optical discs(CD/DVD format) have pits in them. We already have limited devices expected do everything under the sun(their screens aren't efficient solar cells for example even though they look so mono 'crystalline', smashing) - they just have a limited scope because they are not very spectrum efficient and versatile on the receive end, maybe we have to be a Kardeshev scale heavy weight greenhouse solar planet to make that happen eventually(that's stepping up the gamification curve as long as everyone keeps up, I prefer to define gamification as stepping up the game or levelling up, "step it up").****

It is possible to say that crystal radio is EMP or nuclear proof(not the nuclear blast obviously like most things) dependent on construction like thermionic valves or nixie tubes like the dull coloured light bulb shaped devices in some amps or Cathode Ray 'Tube' televisions. Of course it's much simpler than a RADAR station or a 90s TV because said crystal radio circuit does not need power unless you have to add a amp among other things.
You can connect it to a computer and produce some interesting results apart from just expecting the DSP to do all the magic as you do with a typical IF or IQ SDR output from whatever configuration your receiver hardware supports. The main thing is that it works as long as you have a imagination for it to do so, usually many just give up on hardware that's perfectly working and needs a few modifications to do a few more tricks. Basically add a few blocks and see what happens.

For alack of a better performance before being stuck with a choice, you can stick a block diagram in to the mix to get the best results possible with minimum fuss as in effort, parts and labour over man hours before you become too academic about it all such as looking it up in a text book when it already a memory embedded by curiosity that needs a little pep that only imagination can afford. To think of crystal radio as a analogue computer is a curious thought, it does another thing with minimal input no pun intended on the number of signals but it does process radio wave into lesser but humanly useful audio energy with the specific components required maybe a mere handful to less or more depending on how far one wants to go or how pedantic the circuitry design is it is more accurate than typical analogue computing techniques because a dial is useful but if you know what you are looking for with the right wavelengths, the results are reproducible at least for your ears!

Touch screens are not so articulate because it's about mimicking a handheld at the expense of a full sized device's physical real estate, you know the menu interface, there are several devices that have ditched this by default or are just continuing the sole purpose of form and function rather than distraction, there's a level of confidence when you have something that works in most situations without regular button action. All these are turn offs especially when other devices have to be slaved to rely on a mobile device you already have to do a more than a dozen things with already, if you are a minimalist it's a splendid concept except for the cabling issues in niche setups. A crystal radio can only pickup the strongest signals for instance but so does anything else called a radio. In travel people will turn on their radio just like a cell phone as long as there's coverage 5G or SMS via satellite has a very long way to go, it is better to have all forms of radio service while they last(like a battery) even if it's just a internet or hyperlocal service(very limited city/town**). It is possible to create a block diagram for a mobile device but it's only easier to add more design tweaks as value add ons that you have.

In theory having optical networking is enough for some, but the reality is obviously wanting because we can detect laziness(bottlenecks, latency - slow pings), slack or just something simple as least desirable performance during a computer operation which today means apps begging for some CPU time when all they to do is transfer data and act as if they are some kind of server which you have to fiddle a touch screen while the space heating keeps scaling with pure electric semiconductor/copper compute cores, optoelectronic compute cores will lower carbon footprints, energy consumption sustainably rather than just thermal problems.
Positive results require big problems need big time and longer attention spans for real visibility.

A question(s) is how to adopt the components for different electromagnetic wavelengths of the spectrum especially for a optical compute proof of concept not just the obvious quantum computing capability. The idea is to address current limits in Moore's law on Von Neumann Computer architecture, especially simultaneous(async/synchronous) throughput and hybrid applications electrical/optical hardware on current motherboards(this is only possible for data transfer, like memory it is perfectly scalable). See how you pick that apart as any engineer should in theory and practice.

Advantages of Optical Computing

High & Broadband clock speeds you can expect from Optical bandwidths currently up to 20GHz is the best known limit in 2024
Lower Power and Carbon footprint than copper or metal
Efficient Scaling through the roof with nano tech is possible

Other development techniques need to be evaluated for optical computing, to make it practical for people already managing large code based to move on the same way assembler, COBOL, mainframe and punch card operators managed to move on from the last decade until now, people still use punch cards for getting to work in many places around the world for instance, it's a simple task of recording time, date at a work especially factories.
Fair research potential that will possibly allow switch case and choice based programming statements - it will boil down to the tools used to develop new systems with optimisation of existing code for compute heavy tasks, this requires a shift in program design fora specific applications because with more data you really have a good deal of samples and bandwidth to deal without getting bogged down by binary on/off then if the else constructs or program structures - take a whole code base to think of and see what we mean that it's not really making it in the general purpose operations you expect from consumer, industrial or prosumer devices. Follow the topic "Optical Computing" and understand how the compute heavy tasks that rely on GPU/GPGUs are the main target for first generation photonic computing,
commercially of the shelf.

Optical Computing is a low hanger that has to be snatched up and given out as a fruit of decades of labours in the market of current computing hardware tools facing limits in processing abilities and promises from the past, quantum computing won't be common anytime soon but the two are not the same thing, not yet.
They can be positive accelerators that can help solve problems such as portable suns for tongue firmly in cheek humour, as in helping solve tokamaks(stellarators) fusion reactions but who really knows until we are motivated to solve such problems with newer generation of machines, of course more success will bring better materials and aid in space research and space transport power trains - all these things are on hold until it happens because its very easy to dismiss all the written material until someone sees it as something new again with more interesting applications down the road including quantum computing machinery. For anyone curious enough they should have the brains to assemble a kit from a existing motherboard and add more throughput at least to input and output statistics rather than just specifications, which current manufacturing trends are always expected to bust anytime soon, so we expect AMD, ARM, Fujitsu, Intel & TSMC along with all known chip variation(verification) or generics to have this technology sooner rather than later.

A main draw is that people easily accept the socially justifiable habit and expect results because everyone else is doing the same
thing in conflation and generalisation, the error correction is optional just as in shoot from the hip first and get questions later,
a gun fighter complex, so we have more papers and paperwork than available solutions, gamers know gun fighter complex because in
certain games, coordination requires communication and some people simply expect this from a certain place or time as dealt out
by some kind of card dealer as in tarots, gambling arrangements or at the profit rate of at any cost - a balance of probabilities(see 'Mathematics for the Million' by Hogben for a few sentences on the topic just to catch get the gist of it along with objective content online maybe MATH101?),
any scheme that refers to this is usually some kind of casino scam to any participant who does not speak into the realm of words that
are only pixels but a world of meaning, gestures save energy but many aim to take it away when it's really time which is the master
of that gambit - the public does not time travel****, we can make time also carbon can be fabricated, cut, copied then pasted(imprinted/characterised),
so until a vulnerability in carbon dating or tracing is demonstrated and verified by a standards lab, imagination is necessary.
The reference tool is spectrum invisible and limited everyday space in a large metropolis the two go hand in hand,
it is a planning challenge(understatement, see tiny houses online)but a opportunity to use not just so called AI tools but also the blockchain can begin to help
aid spread spectrum algorithms among others, in that respect without scale at rate of distribution of objects as common as on or off grid plugs
will mean that most space or spectrum management ploys will only be applying band aids when tonnes and petabytes need moving without latency along with the
energy which is what submarine fiber does but all this misses the perspective of practical application, rather there's bills even before a the energy to process
data is billed like a creative block until that happens this is just a void, the words can be shifted but the energy debt across the globe and regions is
specific to how much a place can compute at scale without being able to move tonnes of material processed or otherwise in or out, so just knowing how much waste is made against what is produced and seem in the environment is important measure, how many plastics production lines are unaccounted for instance and when that occurred in the past. Most mad made waste can be converted in energy be it biomass, combustible material or gas not just landfill, the limit is the recycling
capability and long you can keep a energy plant on at some defined capacity.
This is not a instructional piece but purely motivational to begin with, because many people now have more access to white paper materials
even as headlines in news outlets on the street or on a screen anywhere around the globe.
We talk about bandwidth as the only reference and even it is the lazy questions around infrastructure, we are not a space faring planet
in the current reality, it's to better to get it right before it imposes its limits on the rest of space,
we are grounded but not exactly going nowhere if you follow the map of stars in the sky(North Star in the Northern Hemisphere or Southern cross) - some still consider a planet to be some kind of spaceship but that is simply a entertainment anecdote or just a hint of what's possible if someone shifts their perspective after getting through a dense reading matter or a longer thinking process because remember conditioning by processing.
Which are never the same in every century, artistic rendition and shared experiences aren't enough. We use the stars including the sun for
basic navigation(astrigation/astral navigation for sailors or pilots alike), calendars and time, also the moon. These are all computations, calculations after basic maybe rigorous as in matters of
practical application of thought over quite a long period of time, older generations may seem to have solved a lot of hard problems but if one
could convey this it is common sense to assert that certain advances are inevitable like movement along a path in a journey of certain thousands
of steps, watching the greater world to see it in this sense without the limit realm of theory to paraphrase Weyl is understanding a level of 'freedom won'
over past limitations, it is necessary to understand the phobias of current limits, the cause and effect of missing a reality where human potential
addresses real matter in space without a reference to time, is not a motivating factor but seeing the physical world neutralising the natural hazards by understanding them and known limits of engineering which we really haven't challenged for a long time expecting comic book nations, Incas, pharaohs among many other to leap into the realm of the current because you really have to be this critical about a lack of progress in many level and acknowledge for what it is not only as a tourist but more than just a visitor, just note how all this is called past wealth all in convenient past tense anywhere in the world .
Basic knowledge has a level of control in certain at the surface of the earth with different elevations, orientations and below the surface under
the unexplored sea(but micro plastics should be there).
Standards in one place are usually not the same in a different place or space, especially when you consider the obvious imperial and metric
measurement schemes as in inches and millimetres. So this is what our minds have to be prepared for in space travel with days longer or shorter on
different planets or moons in orbit of different stars and what bothers before they even venture outside the ionosphere, empty space just because you can't see it
doesn't mean emptiness or vastness because we consider this to be a constant, think about the trash in orbit for instance far far away from you until it eventually drops your TV signal or visits your neighbourhood because it wandered into low earth orbit in the first place but couldn't please Zeus and friends on earth when the a inevitable failure happens.

Machines adding the lift ability and capacity to human effort at scale, we have a number of extreme machinery that has not to be tasked to solve tiny problems that evolve into larger planet scale problems - people on smaller islands believe that tides can be held back mechanically, you know technology watch out for conflation(ery) buffets or general(ismos) saying 'it' at anything or anyone, you don't have to say see 'I told you so' in whitepaper(ish) toilet humour which you can only see online through the unseen university(universities, Pratchett) which you imagine through retentive web pages, thanks CERN what are you doing with the
blockchain, how about blockchain for energy? So we don't have to talk about ALICE and other experiments out of context again for those wondering what they can do in the lab at least imagine or relate to it!
From the turn of the millennia as in 1999 to 2000 who noticed anything different but the odd self dating numbers(such as more zeros, errors) from the calendars in sequencing our days we have noticed on this planet that architecture is not satisfying demand in the built environment with challenging scenarios from weather patterns including geological events that hint at out current level of development in response to rising sea levels or soaring temperatures that demand more energy when all this is nature again advertising energy not exactly the same as a shared experience that's subject to noise and interference.
Abstract level thinking however articulate does not have a physical context in which our ideas translate into real physical reality at the press of a button in a instant or prompt engineering but 3D printing is the closest thing apart from large machines working in symphony, only that it doesn't scale to infrastructure just yet. At the risk of spreading more cliches time will tell when printing will be able to catch up to moulds but that's just a matter of time.
Like anything else human minds need to be charged up by purpose, so do their designs in whatever fashion they follow in abstract creations coming from minds.
We can list a very long list of things listed as fiction in general that are yet to materialise but this should not stop the front end of innovation,
understanding why not is a good question for "innovators dilemma".

Routing is a necessary topic to cover because no one takes the long way home or away unless they have other things to do en route by going south when they are really going north, east when they are going west. This is common when people have connect flights and are willing to split a journey into manageable bits when there is no direct route, so we know travelling well is the ideal so in devices anyone can chalk this down as "human factors" because some apps and devices today will never work without a constant internet connection this is where the red line can be marked at the very beginning, there is also the circuit board and this is where nano tech and Photonics shine literally because of less energy density and more capacity for the same price as plane surface mount metals on a PCB, factor in 3D printing, it will be possible to prototype less from more or however the design is configured, there will be less moving parts in 3D PCBs. Usually design has logic as the under pinning feature for anyone else we assume common sense practicalities, the shortest possible route but in reality you will find habits out of routine with that simple basis(people build traffic controls in gridlock, the answer is newer open source standards via SDN). For airlines these routes change but for a computer network it's always better to get hands on and reroute to the nearest peer in a network when direct peer to peer is not possible.
In computing you can run tracepath and traceroute from the command line(Unix or a least Linux) to get an idea of how your network, content is routed,
it's helpful to see how many hops a ping or byte have to take. Time savings occur when this is closer to the browser for instance but we know this is hardly the case in reality like extra baggage to declare then pay for, you can see why some things don't happen on but especially on slow connections or fast but unstable connections such as mobile wireless.

Atomic scale radio, A diamond radio receiver video and article - https://youtube.com/watch?v=aytf0Jk8YJ4 https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2016/12/the-worlds-tiniest-radio/

"In the Harvard device, electrons in diamond NV centers are powered, or pumped, by green light emitted from a laser. These electrons are sensitive to electromagnetic fields, including the waves used in FM radio. When NV center receives radio waves. It converts them and emits the audio signal as red light. A common photo diode converts that light into a current, which is then converted to sound through a simple speaker or headphone.

An electromagnet creates a strong magnetic field around the diamond, which can be used to change the radio station, tuning the receiving frequency of the NV centers." NV(Nitrogen Vacancy).

So obviously AMD has a patent on Photonic chips the rest is news and Intel has had a Photonics Lab for a while in Santa Clara,
you only need to look at your existing fiber to the home or premise to see it roll out but you need your machines to crash less and depend less on the grid.
Santa Barbara has a good optics lab, TSMC is working on hybrid chip architecture. Any optics and Photonics(any physics/chemistry) lab with a good mind in it already on the topics should have what to create very basic prototypes.
We can talk about Exascale, Petascale and maybe Yottascale HPC/Super Computing but people will always underestimate how much energy just like trash which is very mobile like micro plastics, you get in recycled products - you will need nano scale plastic busters soon. Under estimation comes easy when data streams across the board are on the table using Youtube, Google and any other service they use(AOL, Apple Cloud, MS, Yahoo et cetera). But we can expect more scaling for networks which really are really High Performance Networks. That's how it scales down to users who can see it via content delivery networks and edge of the network(4G, 5G Wireless, Fiber loops. Some still use copper - unfortunately which isn't very theft resistant).

Zetta Scale IO for the software defined data center https://www.hpcwire.com/2023/03/16/optical-io-technology-needed-for-zettascale-say-top-companies/

So Intel has it's Neural Net chip(named Loihi) like all the stuff you used to see from television from CALTECH & MIT
from the 60s - 80s and so on that has scaled the learning behind the technology into a fabricated chip,
there is research around the world analogue and quantum computing still inspired from the
first specimens, IIT Bombay has a prototype neural machine, it is interesting to note to what extent the
lack of development of analog computers from the 90s until recently mothballed the development of optical computers
for any curious as to why, in case anyone thinks analogue or neural computing was sidetracked
upon further research you will find it as the precursor to current AI or generative applications.
All past developments go into making current quantum computer prototypes and a bit more in future.
You can see Photonics as your fiber into your home/office and some of your audio video
equipment but these devices are simply the medium because you can scale with less power than metal cabling
which is the problem you will faces when you try to pack more metallic content t the expense of how long
you can keep that going according Gordon Moore you need to read the law in plain English as it online
rather than a abstract mathematical formulae and Shannon's law, along with all that you only need
to understand how much energy and further equipment you save to achieve.
So we have chemical chain reactions, osmosis in substance so lets consider reality to be full
of air on the surface, hydrogen(H for Hope as LCD, Lowest Common Denominator and hope for sarcasm, mode dependent).
Then you have all your airborne undesirables that pay no taxes such as harmful chemicals natural or man made, diseases
and the oxygen or water you need among many other things, animals insects pass through
borders with no reference to process except for migration and 'zoonosis' across species - which is
the process that led to the gap for reaction to SARS's exploitation to mutate into COVID(zoonotic disease)
in the wild, as a mutation, we talk about that only in the wild so we worry less about it in the
computing or data centres especially as users who only interact with certain sites - offline is
another thing, so that's ecosystem surveillance on the face of it digital or natural world history
regardless. It's still very easy to accuse bandwidth as the main culprit, did it create under service
in minds before it grabbed headlines in its various strains such as Omicron(O in the greek alphabet not OHH).
It is possible to remember this because posters at medical chambers(doctors) came with explanations about
bird flu and SARS in 2002 apart from it being  virtually 'all up in your eyes, ears and hair' at the time,
with this online, on the radio, television or the now more deprecated press clearly it is extremely
easy to say this in hind sight that no bandwidth was properly used at the time until it came
around half circle because it keeps on mutating like most bugs that are media superstars, it is not
uncommon in grade school for said viruses to be characterised as 'people' in long walks home(work)
pep talks that are quite interestingly not vague(en) until they join the 'workforce.'
Viruses feed on chain reactions so this one had a huge gap in time to do as much damage as it could until 2021.
Eventually the unscientific public is not equipped to test or resist routines such as breathing,
this unscientific public includes various members of the animal family whose advocates during
the lock down were shocked as to why canines were not co opted in time to detect disease by sniffing,
it is interesting how cyber security borrows so much from  cats and dogs.
Among various other talents, well take it from me, you don't have any four legged friends that
have to be classified as lazy but you can scapegoat until we maximise or minimise
the human factor, whatever the situations faced recently I simply minimised my social contact but didn't quit clubbing.
So cue citizen, open science in place, as smart as a dog can be there's no point to put it in harm's way when we can
automate the task. EU USB is comically enforced.
So is health when carefully considering built environment(urban planning) and this is not a
public discourse but a private discussion between a health provider usually exercised under
client privilege by showing up. These devices are still relatively new, so there is still so
much ground to cover because there are simply a lot of people that worried about any type of well known
bug issues at the turn of the millennia, in retrospect.
As in doctors chambers usually, some people don't care that a smart watch can record
a histogram of their health vital statistics(dependent on battery life),
begging a pardon for practical application and how you don't need another lock down to make you
think like Nikola Tesla about USB cabling or disease detection when said
disease happened in 2002 and Nikola is no more but not for the same
dramatic reasons in his century or generation, there were various maladies in the era of Bell, Edison or Tesla.
We can look forward to scaling out health in the largest metropolis at the users' earliest convenience such as
considering battery life telehealth or remote medicine, there is no need to be retrospective
and retroactive in application practically.

Why talk about cable standards, like Lego blocks they connect everything - it's possible to minimise cabling with wireless charging/power for newer devices, efficient devices in hostile environments containing high levels of unshielded and end user initiated consumption of spectrum resources, the number of devices per person per grid square on a map has to be considered especially from first person experience with devices in a room/block. So we can talk about Micro QSFP(µQSFP), a interface for newer Ethernet connectors that support Power over Ethernet simultaneously with metal cable and optical cable that is thermally stable, so scalable from USB-A it is a overkill in it's purest form but it can be scaled down to make it possible to support USB-Ethernet for instance with new boards/chips for smarter cable outlays. The idea is simple, replace the insulator plastic with a optical media terminator to do both.
What is MicroQSFP http://fowiki.com/b/introduction-to-%CE%BCqsfp-transceiver/
Visualise other USB possibilities https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB
You can compare using an existing connector in your hands. It's better to have fiber like speeds so that audiophiles, computer/electronic builders, radio amateurs or pros can scale out new products in their setups with direct onboard functions that are not limited to the setup of too many cables(PoE, PoF, RFoF, Multi session  content over fiber and so on). This is complementary to GaN semiconductor power banks or blocks you now use for some Audio/Video components, computers, gaming, mobile peripherals using the plain USB standard for power, it's promising when in mobility you can expect more than 200 watts from a 3 pin plug in vehicle while it stinks of fuel or simply add the power bank to a struggling power train in the real world were there's work to do(some people do it but not as great as it they want it to be be, look at futurists predictions wherever you can find them and look at how fast USB was taking of faster than WiFi from 1999 and on your many devices till today going forward henceforth when you see it - relativity is important 'it is said').

"µQSFP, also known as MicroQSFP, is a high-speed IO interface system that connects server, storage, switch, video, and communication systems. It supports both copper and optical cabling and has improved thermal performance." https://www.connectortips.com/microqsfp-cage-connectors-modules-and-cable-are-being-launched-this-week/

Apart from EMC product shielding against strategies it is possible to shrink USB cables to USB-Fiber/Ethernet/P2P networking or scale up for hybrid operation to achieve more from less (space and time) with PoF, RFoF as we break into future generations of Ethernet standards, this is a possible route to scale µQSFP connections in the scheme of QSFP down to an SFP size while the QSFP-DD doubles lane count and so on while supporting better human user focused ergonomics. From µQSFP connections you can replace the pure plastic USB component into a active/passive µQSFP connection into host hardware or cable bundles that can support existing or new fiber standards with network media converter kits.

Ethernet Road map and Graphic Poster available via http://www.ethernetalliance.org/
Please note the current caps on Ethernet and fiber speeds, there in.

Less is more especially in consumer devices that have the core microelectronics because it is necessary to get more from less and vice versa without a high cable count, component count, the higher the function to component ratio the better because they are still moving parts that have to be physically moved to a plant from a IC fabrication in someone's hands even if it's additive manufacturing in the process, so lessening the energy or carbon footprint to offer a direct interface to making the next generation of connectivity in the "consumer's face" just for fun to begin with(gaming, mobile, micro HPC clusters) is a start because we need to spend less time for storage and peripherals to make transfers to make more time for ourselves counts as innovation.
Resilient devices that are agile in spectrum use will be smarter because it possible to cancel out the noise be it man made or lack there of content, in digital it matters what the source is, it is necessary to exploit spectrum black spots  It's always good to know what your batteries are charged up for before you map out a place on a mountain top to climb, applications alone are vague the main idea is to add value when there's no data to add value with context, meaning.
So the next best thing is LiFi but all standards may share common development or test beds, on the face of things all them look mutually exclusive as finished products, that's what it just looks like but convergence, hybrid means more minimal footprints for products that do more with smaller footprints. The possibilities are endless, going forward the applications are really finite. Making them very feasible product engineering materials, looking forward to 6G and 7G wireless standards as the spectrum creep follows, it is absolutely necessary to exploit every mile, meter at any scale to see that through from the longest wavelengths to the visible or invisible spectra so that the first inch of the last mile can be covered.
In, a home or office still needs better alternatives because it's now not uncommon to have over use of a handheld device in a fixed setting to compliment a listening or viewing session for a device that has enough resources to playback media of all things, this means certain components or content are missing across the board, it's not just the signal but the image of it that most people are turned of by. All these are turn offs.
Better design can make up for useful rights to repair in the face of after market modifications we know people can't be stopped from making a device work better after market(ing) missing features.

Mind the gap(s) is the subtext in this whole text***. With mobile it comes the dilution, disinformation most likely distraction and isolation which is not very helpful when you have to drive for instance or continue in routines that can only be built around being 'under served', so mobile devices can be made to be more smarter by syncing gestures and routines as part of user profiles not just ambient noise or whatever you can want from noise cancelling, these devices are initially time savers until they run into a specific challenge that users are expected to perform.
It is better to sell the user one product with most product features as you see in car radios that are more likely to distract the user especially when a car radio is a "smart device", how many manuals do these smart devices get, when was the last time you got a smart or mobile device with a user manual unless you check or ask, especially if you demand it? From that description you don't need to be sitting at the patent office(IP -Intellectual Property Organisations not just IP addresses or legal chambers) or any standards body to understand that people still have more access to some form radio than TV or a mobile that can be actively considered to doing something useful to or for them, so with disengagement from listeners or readers there's too much information, much ado about nothing everywhere anywhere anytime, you will find out you may have the best experience online when you are location agnostic, specifications for content and a physical product(physical content) always converge in the mind.
Some chassis in some devices are practically empty vessels very good at having the cheapest(trendiest) available bits just everyone else is having them but with everything looking like something else, there will be more waste. So this a design motivation to avoid having 'the nothing', people litter because they see other doing it so for network effects people easily drink the milk as long as it's good at the time of drinking(some do it because it's the only thing, very agrarian rural offsets like someone catching FM with a huge antenna what's wrong with AM(analogue/digital) on all the free spectrum, radio bands?),

    - you don't need a 4G or 5G connection to run a certain app in the middle of nowhere,
    - likewise you don't need to stack so many applications, boxes or cables
    - You don't have to do the things done in the 80s, 90s, 00s, especially now(not like 60s - 70s)!

Even for commercial of the shelf applications in towers, data and network centres for large operations, incoming 5G iterations, 6G, 7G and so on are only telecommunications standards not broadcast standards for cell towers. When push comes to shove every one can't be connected to the same server*, not just yet getting a one way stream on finite bandwidth via limited spectrum. The blockchain can scale content/server infrastructure on demand to share it appropriately but that's beyond the scope of most design briefs but it is possible to share many more devices than on typical client(dependent app/browser) server(dinosaur) scenarios were it can be bull fight rodeo on what's the master or slave device, something users don't have to worry about in forward looking setups. Failure also has a network effect, when people imitate it and the network has to carry it because they don't have to think about how many packets are dropped or whether they are using IPv6, self healing software defined networking stacks that can see beyond the edge of the network spectrum. Like networks the blockchain is in use from seed to table with the business logic in between to facilitate an almost forensic carbon footprint traceability packets of goods or services in the cloud available at a moment's notice. It's also being used for energy monitoring applications for offgrid applications or simply independent power supplies in specific use cases across the board, my mentioning it is only the tip of the iceberg because individuals are powering this blockchain devolution, evolution or revolution as a catalyst or simple enabler that doesn't require massive footprints of hardware to achieve whatever the norm would have been a month or a decade ago.

*cell towers aren't data centres with architects designed HVAC - cooling services with CHP power plants - they usually generate enough warmth but no cooling, this is off topic and out of bounds till we reach the context where an architect or industrial designer can draw it out apart from stating the obvious limitations of existing debts, technical debts. Other natural examples are ant hills/termite mounds clearly referenced at Eastgate Complex in Harare near the train station(see NatGeo YouTube/Online Pictures), the building still contains a data centre.
Newer generation computing can solve such problems with better carbon neutrality and thermal footprints using more than just the grid, so again, so do newer materials.
Eastgate on youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=620omdSZzBs


** DRM Digital Radio Mondiale's evolving broadcast standard which has been around since the first commercial WiFi routers which I could promote directly to some banking people offers a way to lift the burden from expecting to cover a certain number of listeners via AM bands(Long, Medium and Short Waves) in analogue and digital formats right up to the usual FM bands with hybrid support, the standard developed at the same time as DVB-S for Radio, WorldSpace, Sirius along with XMRadio unlike all these versatile satellite radio modes it's still in the acceptance/testing phase in different parts of the globe unlike satellite radio which is always about one location with one dish for most of the world, see DRM.org including some software defined radios and hardware radios, https://www.iis.fraunhofer.de/en/ff/amm/broadcast-streaming/multimediaplayer.html there is one or two examples on github or gitlab including SDR software such as GNU radio or software for external hardware that can demodulate digital radio modes in general, you can connect just about any radio, depending on performance you can expect basic listening just by connecting a long wire but this may overload incapable receivers or hardware setups - so this is where you can use a simple crystal radio to get a few stations. The thing about radio is that it's small(can be much smaller) and you can be in the middle of the desert or ocean to pick it unlike most internet services you can't expect total coverage on every grid square on the world map but you can try if you have to until you get someone to do it. Radio, Amateur Radio Service, Broadcast Service including Satellite Services.
It's important to note that internet service providers are not exactly relay stations but as long as the packets can fit expect it to work but not very well when you move because there's the gap you will here when bits dropped from a buffer coming to you via your stream of choice and it will be useful to have more robust spectrum efficiency from multiple sources be they analogue or digital especially easier to sync with existing firmware which can be updated with new patches or  made into better software. Digital always means software. For radio it's always been a block diagram depending on the components you have to add it also means continuous integration of new build and features to complement hardware profiles.

At various stages we will be able to visualise in text and eventually by graphics because in touch typing is faster while it's slower to
upload graphics just as is to modify the physical environment unlike scraping the internet and socials especially for specific tidbits.
There is structure in wording and a picture speaks a thousand words but there is much convincing in the road ahead, judging by any
level of interaction on the receiving end online.
Tools without contextual content will not solve any problems but with human guided direction and focus will allow for especially in a time
limited scope we expect the hands on tinkerer to achieve more, this is the challenge in that we are still carrying over bugs
any field in relation to how we solve problems everyday human routine, we take for granted how we go about it but the lingering
is that is always a better way, a limit is how many people can actually take note and carry on the correction of measurable bugs
in content unlike text which is a soft problem maybe a hard problem depending on how you compute the problem at hand along with its scale.
Hesitation is not a rewarding venture by milliseconds or years of dither when a comical picture has to be drawn by way of second hand
not first hand experiences of human interaction in age of centuries old bugs in addition to abstract ghosts in the machine,
it's very easy to be consumers of existing communications on socials but not reality to expect this to scale in every mind just because we
have a portable devices that allow us to do so, there is the time limit to achieve and its very easy never to know unless trends are
the only thing people want to be a part of in the human experience which is more than just a shared experience. When books have value so do words.
Books can be anything in different places, but they have to survive on medium of exchange of knowledge which of course in that regard people offers
economics as a another yardstick so does the mere exchange of information with equals or those looking to join such as discourse. Because you don't have
to wait to talk to author as long as you can converse on a topic such as the link you see online here across the web at least those who don't can look at themselves as those who like to be in reigns of repeating history as a favourite time pass or past time put together in isolation. At some point it is possible
that almost everyone has written enough text online to be able to be considered writing a book that's fantasy I'll leave for publishing A&R(can't help it)
for lack of a better analogy.

You would think some science fiction writers would be disappointed with the current achievements, it's a matter of context, there is more now than
more than a century ago but we don't have to pin point the diseases and natural events that will always advance or linger because we have a world that people believe hinges on economics first and foremost before anything else.
Since it's a science, then it is obvious that everyone doesn't have the time to dedicate to science even if they are scientists by training, some
social circles simply take on the popular job trend. So in these trends science has a constant delivery of facts which are not what everyone
wants at every single moment inside a office window, if you get the drift. The inside is fragile so is the outside when it human designed and
rather than weathered by continuous testing in a rigorous environment that still has things such as weather be it terrestrial or space
in play along with so called nature(AI, landscaping, planning), after all certain aspects take second or last place in place to human needs.
So we have small objects for micro managing but no large scale machines in action to feel or know that natural cycles can be controlled as put
forward by science fiction writers decades ago, we use geostationary satellite to watch TV, surf the internet, get real time weather data among the many applications.
The gap of scale is important, the limit of expectations or ideas yet to be realised is overarching the backdrop in a (multi dimensional) reality.
do not need time consuming lectures on reality because intellectual property output has a time to reach it's intended audience, in taking
time to reach the world we have well known limits such as thinking one thought at a time, in keeping a open mind we struggle to see in
how learning is having a impact when you can spend a few months in college and have a paper with or without value just because you can understand
a few topics, there's always the question of potential and achieving specific goals so in carbon dating always ask the question what if
content can time travel because time capsules are not every day object we create or interact with, in that way we can view the
objects or designs then improve upon them. How often has this happened to justify that this is a improvement.
Many real world problems are not Clay, Fields or Nobel award problems but we know well taught people are expected to apply their minds in a profession,
don't need to be time travellers to synthesise content on demand and apply to existing solutions understanding on a measurable value index on what we expect to achieve in the realm of engineering and science along a route, inevitably these do not have to be purely incidental but planned activity.
That's as simple as synchronising events on paper is a very important skill and you don't have to be a classically train musician to convey meaning and understanding for this but it can help just like a comic book artist can draw a cabaret, street theatre or travelling circus.
The new millennium and many people had to adjust their clocks to accommodate more zeroes, now clocks have better accuracy and resolution to aid the
timekeeper in keeping in step with the reality of movement automatically, at least on this planet earth were we impose various controls for the sake of making devices and movement human controllable variables.
So minds need some kind of rest some, motivation, stimulus and sustenance this is not a lot of energy when we simply translate circumstance or
happenstance into some kind of formulae, the mind of the crowd is fickle but the thinking mind needs sustenance by way of material knowledge.
It's easy to talk about zombie economics but it takes real zombies to make that happen or just plain large scale IP theft by enforcing of lack productivity
as in a challenged environment that promotes overthinking and inaction(brain freeze/creative blocks apart from crashing/hanging machines not Google Fhangouts).

We understand low level applications and think at the human to human(B2B?), higher level but we have to communicate and live above a mere performance were
time is limited, think this way with the same routine and you are in deep sleep performing the same routine. Now some people keep tonnes of books, this
is not in my nature or many others giving away only counts when books are read intellectual exchange at any level is facilitated(not dumped as in given away) which what we have through the Internet, it always helps to have the objectivity and subjectivity specifying with consistency what the subject matter maybe, this is what
archives do sometimes there are published records of proceedings on a subject matter, chronicles, journals, papers or volumes of compendiums and so on but this depends on authors who publish said reading materials - so in the age of the internet we have the semantic web and we library software that can help archivists or
explorers of archives to go through digitised artefacts by subject matter the same way you use a search spider to find your Lego puzzle toys, by subject matter.
Can time be easily deducted unless you always expect it to be what the calendar and clock time says as long you can correct them(atomic time) -
then it should matter, when it simply is matter of unconscious thoughts in sleep as real as anything might be in the mind it is a
abstract experience with no reference to time, space or material but pure experience.
Which can be misleading because can anyone really tell time until they wake from a deep sleep even if they do some people claim they are living in a
dream? So it's very easy to fool our minds into conforming into a trend and nothing more rather than the needs that trend across boundaries without regard
to high or low level thinking.
In getting things done certain things have been overlooked in the race of trends be they mega or micro trends, we still need a good handle
on things to get by without worrying about the state of the planet because this is the immediate reality for island dwellers who are facing
rising tides for instance, whatever it can be called is missing the obvious point because one has to be upfront to see the damage and be willing
to move. Nature is considered by some in science fiction to be AI so this is a niche not a reactive lily gilding debating society topic, a first person
 reality to be face by those willing to change it, maybe survive it at the very least because the narrative is so blatantly obvious?

People expect things to happen because they can just generate content but it's only just content(just like someone who expect grade inflation as in saying A A A and son should translate to A+ AA+ AAA+ you see, say it like a donkey braying - gun fighter complex), there's the physical reality that every device is a electronics gadget with some software and you can only go so far with generalisations with the latest abbreviation or the ones that have been floating around for years because there's the content in the physical world that still needs a lot of work, robots are not going to magically appear with all the work done or just do it, in other words, most ideas are stuck on storage and data centres especially dead leaves called pages on books rather than just shortened acronyms in confusion or theories - so you can see code as the last resort of a finished piece of work, it has to have a software as a service(design) from a set of tools a system integrator has at their fingertips, software defined services still require a lot of code, it's always better to skip it as long as there's dedicated hardware with software neatly hidden from sight with only service visible.
The blockchain isn't solving hard physical problems but it can given the right minds and compute power over a period of time, because it's solving other problems such as the sharing economy on mobile at scale starting somewhere(see site below).
The sharing economy for incoming data in the next generation internet on the blockchain is new territory. This is a use case that can be scaled to spectrum efficiency applications in existing operations for evolving networks(follow #ITUData on socials).

Growing up with a engineer is a marvel got anyone willing to explore, today it is possible to solve several problems, the physical reality
spells out there's more missing and incomplete architecture or infrastructure, the question of solving specific problems has many limiting
resource scarce language and vocabulary that demands people to be experts in a domain and field of issues to solve, so now I you don't need
multiple kilos and pounds of encyclopedias to answer somewhat academic albeit grade school questions or to distract a engineer in the household
unless they have a pastime shared within. So you we can generalise socials and point out that each site provides a avenue for those that have
to discuss or at least offer a place discussion online.
I say this from experience because in growing up my father was not just a engineering manager but a publisher who managed a warehouse,
logistics to deliver and customer services, one of my question about the reference catalogue was why we didn't see the 'Encyclopaedia Britannica'
because it was too weighty and expensive but some schools could afford it after,
awhile not for everyone with up to three dozen books in one edition in the nineties with which should put the deluge of material knowledge into some
context looking at it in retrospect - very easy to say it now in abstract terms.
Translation, there was no market for it then but now we have Wikis, encyclopaedias are no longer just a elite school fancy item or relic,
anyone can have it on demand from different sources online which I used at the time, so reference books are still something that needs to thumped
on a very regular basis. From grade school I have been in college since twelve but not in the same place because it's a place I started to walk on
my own just before kindergarten, of course I just couldn't stand still even if a computer was with just a defunct motherboard, a solar cell calculator, the radio sets, recordings or a lot of science related reading materials don't forget toys musical instruments can only be considered toys if they don't serve a specific
purpose of entertainment were professional draw the line such as with things such as a piano, a grand piano or not - you can really see it as furniture especially at schools were there was one person officially 'ordained' to play it.
Anybody knows that electric cars have been there since the 'Model T' thanks to things such as Formulae E, we know we don't expect see hyper sonic air travel for instance because we have conditioned ourselves into rationalising abstract content as a be all and end all in a world of words when there is the environment to master not to the other way around, time isn't bling or a scalable bong, because people are really aiming to do the most mundane routines, it's good to look at a a process as design tasks then reconfigure any step in a algorithm or process.
In many places human interaction is missing but this is a advantage when it can make the most difference and we have a simple
medium in radio that still facilitates the solving of basic problems by interaction with relatively compact, mobile, portable computing
that's at the limit of it's efficiency of getting things done, it is easy to look at spectrum as value alone there is also everything else with
software at the centre of spectrum usage were applicable.
We have many computer aided manufacturing tools that are now in the hands of individuals not just labs or showrooms - today it's not
impossible to see a virtual show case and see a finished product upon delivery from a fully digital supply chain guiding to, the receiver can be the
customer to give them a better journey into the world with more understanding for their particular task at hand.
